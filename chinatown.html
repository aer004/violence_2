      <p>The two photographs above are both works of photographer Doroathea Lange.
        The difference between them is the signifier: "Impounded".
        The WRA, the War Relocation Authority, deemed the impounded photo on the with the solider unacceptable
        the American people to consume. The same scene, without the solider, was allowed to be published.

      <p>Ansel Adams was also asked by the WRA to photograph the Japanese concentration camps.
        Unlike Lange, he was able to publish a book of his photographs, which were all approved by the WRA.
        These are pages from his book.
